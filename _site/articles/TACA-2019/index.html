<b>Title: Algebraic Methods for Deciding Tensor Equivalence (tutorial)</b></p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://www.bucknell.edu/academics/arts-and-sciences-college-of/academic-departments-and-programs/mathematics/faculty-and-staff/peter-brooksbank">Peter Brooksbank</a>, Bucknell</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The purpose of this mini-course is to introduce algebraic tools that help to elucidate the structure of tensors. The focus will be on tensors of valence 2, or bilinear maps as they are also known. The main objects of study will be rings of matrices associated to a bilinear map that are invariant under isomorphism. These include commutative rings (centroids), rings with involution  (adjoints), and Lie rings (derivations).</p>

<p>The motivation to study such rings comes from several directions. First, the structure and representation theory of these various types of rings is, to a greater or lesser extent, well understood. Secondly, that structure may in turn be used to decompose and study the associated bilinear map. Finally, since the defining conditions of these rings are all systems of linear equations, they can be constructed very efficiently from the given bilinear map.</p>

<p>Among the objectives of the mini-course are the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A survey of algorithms for computing with matrix algebras.</li>
  <li>An analysis of algebraic methods to test equivalence of tensors––successes and outstanding challenges.</li>
  <li>An introduction to software for computing with tensors and their associated algebras.</li>
</ol>

<b>Title: <a href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/~hulpke/talks/P19.pdf">Computational Group Theory</a> (tutorial)</b></p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/~hulpke/">Alexander Hulpke</a>, CSU</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> These lectures are intended to give an overview of Concepts, Ideas, Tools, and Main results in Computational Group Theory (CGT), aimed at researchers who have just a basic idea of the concept of groups (knowing what a homomorphism is will be enough) but do not necessarily aim to specialize in the area. Focussing on the case of permutation groups and matrix groups, I will describe the what and why of the problems CGT considers, the assumptions that are made on input, the fundamental data structures that are used (and how they are constructed), and  some ways how these tools can be used in solving problems that are outside the scope of the basic algorithms.</p>

<p><a name="Grochow"></a>
<b>Title: Tensors &amp; Complexity (tutorial)</b></p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jgrochow/">Joshua A. Grochow</a>, CU Boulder</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The first lecture will be about what computational complexity can tell us about tensors. We will review notions of reductions between problems, how we can use these notions of reduction to learn about computational difficulty. We will then cover what is known about the complexity of a variety of problems on tensors, including a first look at some very recent results (only going up on the arXiv this week!).</p>

<p>The second lecture will be about what tensors can tell us about computational complexity. We will see several ways - both direct and indirect - in which problems on tensors lie at the heart of lower bounds in complexity theory.</p>

<p><a name="Maglione"></a>
<b>Title: <a href="https://slides.com/joshmaglione/taca2019"> A tensor playground: a demonstration of TensorSpace</a></b></p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://joshmaglione.weebly.com/">Josh Maglione</a>, U. Bielefeld</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> New algorithms for tensors change the way we compute with and manipulate tensors. Making room for modern theory while keeping the tried and true is the purpose of TensorSpace. We demonstrate how to build a tensor space system and apply it to known problems.</p>

<p><a name="Miyazaki"></a>
<b>Title: On the complexity of MIN-RANK and its applications</b></p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="http://www.cs.trincoll.edu/~miyazaki/">Takunari Miyazaki</a>, Trinity College</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> The problem of finding a low-rank linear combination of matrices is a fundamental problem in linear algebra. Its decision version, called MIN-RANK, is also an important subject in computational complexity theory. In this talk, I will discuss MIN-RANK’s fundamental properties and highlight its various roles in cryptography.</p>

<p><a name="Moore"></a>
<b>Title:Noisy Tensors and Machine Learning (tutorial)</b></p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~moore/">Cris Moore</a>, Santa Fe Institute</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Someone gives you a tensor. You have a hunch that it is a noisy observation of an underlying tensor which is low rank. Depending on what kind of noise has been applied, can you recover the underlying matrix, at least approximately? Can you do this efficiently? And how much noise can you tolerate? And what does this have to do with statistical physics?</p>

<b>Title: Tensors in Multiparameter Persistent Homology</b></p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/~akp/">Amit Patel</a>, CSU</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Let K<sub>0</sub>⊆ … ⊆ K<sub>n</sub> = K be a 1-filtration of a finite simplicial complex. As the filtration parameter increases, cycles are born and cycles die. This history of births and deaths is neatly described by a discrete invariant called its persistence diagram. The most important property of the persistence diagram is that is stable to perturbations of the filtration. Its computation involves setting up a boundary matrix followed by a reduction that maintains the filtration. The problem of multiparameter persistent homology is the study of births and death of cycles in an n-filtration of K. Until very recently, this problem was poorly understood. We now have a notion of a multiparameter persistence diagram and it is stable [1]! We are now focused on its computation which involves tenors.</p>

<b>Title: Tensors in Enumeration: Counting Orbits and Conjugacy Classes</b></p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="http://www.maths.nuigalway.ie/~rossmann/">Tobias Rossman</a>, NUI Galway</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> This talk is devoted to the enumeration of orbits and conjugacy classes of finite p-groups. By a process of linearisation, the study of such enumerative problems turns out to be closely related to understanding average sizes of kernels of operators associated with bilinear maps. In addition to exhibiting a rich algebraic structure, this connection also casts some light on the arithmetic and geometric questions hiding inside seemingly group-theoretic problems.</p>

<b>Title: <a href="https://slides.com/shonk/tensors">Tensors in Differential Geometry</a></b></p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/~clayton/">Clayton Shonkwiler</a>, CSU</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> I will give an introduction to the fundamental role played by tensors in differential geometry, with particular emphasis on the idea of a tensor as a multilinear map. This will include brief cameos by some of the most important tensors in geometry: vector fields, differential forms, Riemannian metrics, and the Riemann and Ricci curvature tensors. Time allowing, I will also present an intriguing tensorial connnection between Plucker coordinates on Grassmann manifolds and projection matrices; this last is joint work with Harrison Chapman.</p>

<b>Title: Tensors in Quantum (tutorial)</b></p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> TBA</p>

<p><a name="Wilson"></a>
<b>Title: <a href="https://slides.com/jameswilson-3/tensors-operators#/">Tensors Spaces &amp; Operators</a></b></p>

<p><strong>Speaker:</strong> <a href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/~jwilson/">James B. Wilson</a>, CSU</p>

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Concepts, examples, and notation of tensors can be quite varied, which presents a real barrier to communicating about problems and solutions regarding tensors.  Like vector spaces, <strong>tensor spaces</strong> make a uniform treatment possible without overriding any existing interpretation of individual tensors.  This bridges talk about tensors between varied disciplines.</p>
