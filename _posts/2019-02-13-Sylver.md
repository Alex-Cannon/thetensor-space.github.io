# Sylver

Sylver solves simultaneous Sylverster equations $AX+BY=C$ in as fast a way as currently possible.

Linear Sylvester systems $AX+BY=C$ appear as a primitive linear equations across mathematics, physics, and engineering.  **Concurrent Sylvester Systems**  batch together multiple Sylvester Systems into Tensor Sylvester systems and solves them concurrently with provably nearly optimal speed and minimal memory usage.

e.g. finding solutions $(X,Y)$ that simultaneously solve:
$$\begin{array}{ccccc}
A_{1} X & + & B_{1} Y & = & C_1\\
\vdots & &\vdots  & & \vdots\\
A_{m} X & + & B_{m} Y & = & C_m
\end{array}$$ 
These, and general higher-dimensional Tensor Sylvester Systems, can be solved with minimum space and in time just slightly more than linear in the input size.  They also admit natural parallelism and randomized solutions.  **Sylver** is our library of routines to solve Sylvester Systems.
