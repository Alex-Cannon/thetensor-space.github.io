    - **Hike one of Colorado's 14ner** Weather permitting we plan to hike one of Colorado's "14ners" (a mountain peak above 14,000 feet above sea level).  Of the more than 50 such peaks in the region we will choose one that is appropriate for beginners but still we recommend you participated only if your fit for the hike.
