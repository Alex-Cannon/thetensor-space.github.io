## Excursions

  * **Saturday June 8, 2019**  For participants of both sides of the program we will be planning some informal excursions you can participate in.  All the activities below are at your own risk and responsiblity.  We are offering only the timeline details.
    - **Hike one of Colorado's 14ner** Weather permitting we plan to hike one of Colorado's "14ners" (a mountain peak above 14,000 feet above sea level).  Of the more than 50 such peaks in the region we will choose one that is appropriate for beginners but still we recommend you participated only if you are fit for such a hike.  
    - **Rocky Mountain National Park** A historic park for all the right reasons.  Arrange trips here in small groups.  We can suggest good trails.  If staying overnight consider lodging in Estes Park.   The YMCA has many options located next to the park.
